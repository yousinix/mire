# mire: rewire your mind

mire helps you achieve your goals, not efficiently, but effectively. It breaks down your goals into manageable little tasks that each one has a "cognitive challenge" which simulates your brain's in new ways to help you grow.

## Background

### Name

I wanted the name to have both "mind" and "wiring" in it. Then I have realized that "W" in wire can be an "M" in mind flipped horizontally. So I came up with "mire".

### Idea

Originally, I was gonna do a "cooking recipe generator" app with some cool features, but I wanted to build it with Svelte instead of React, to unlock new connections in my brain and increase my neuroplasticity. But then I thought, why not build something that helps me increase my neuroplasticity instead? And so the idea of mire was born.

Neuroplasticity is a very interesting topic for me, since I have heard from a doctor before:

> This _thing_ can only be fixed in childhood, and it's impossible for adults to change how their brain works.

Then I thought "Isn't every adult different and we cannot generalize this assumption?". For example, it's very well known that learning languages is easier for kids, but there are exceptional adults who can learn new languages even faster than kids. For example, J. Robert Oppenheimer learned Dutch in about six weeks.

So I took this thought, and started doing things in unusual new ways to unlock new neural connections. Going out of comfort-zone, learning new things that are known to be more difficult for adults, and so on. In a nutshell, by increasing your neuroplasticity, you can **teach your brain how to learn** new things more easily.

mire is my attempt to build a tool that helps me and others increase our neuroplasticity by doing small cognitive challenges while achieving our goals.

## Technical Stack

| Technology  | Purpose              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| SvelteKit   | Full-stack framework |
| TailwindCSS | Styling              |
| Langchain   | LLM orchestration    |
| OpenAI      | LLM (GPT-5-mini)     |

## Future Plans

mire is just getting started. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- **Enhanced gamification**: badges, levels, achievements, and reward systems
- **Personalized challenges**: cognitive tasks tailored to your preferences and learning history
- **Progress tracking**: detailed statistics to visualize your neuroplastic journey
- **Feasibility validation**: an intelligent agent to ensure generated tasks are realistic and achievable
